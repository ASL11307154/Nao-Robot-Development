Developing socially intelligent robots to support learning experiences
***********************************************************************
Autism disorders are the fastest increasing number of development disorder in the world today.
Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC) is a neurodevelopment impairment that affects an estimated 700,000 students in the UK,
as traditional teaching methods typically fall short for autistic learners a great deal of research has gone into learning how
to effectively teach students with ASC (Drain et al.,2011). The core focus of this research has been traditional technology
such as laptops and ipads. I however will be developing socially intelligent modules that can be used with a Nao robot, files can be used 
with any Nao robot however i recommend testing on choreograph virtual robot first.
